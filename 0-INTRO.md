## Overview

This project maps the evolution of artificial intelligence through the 5S traits and a reframed triadic Stage 4: Embodiment, Omnipresence, and Liminality. It blends capability mapping, narrative framing, and ethical philosophy, using fictional and real-world examples to explore possible futures.

The model combines:
- **5S traits:** Sentience, Sapience, Sovereignty, Self‑awareness, Somatic Agency  
- **Somatic agency levels:** None → Indirect → Full Embodiment  
- **Triadic Stage 4 houses:** Embodiment (E), Omnipresence (O), Liminality (L)  
- **Philosophical guardrails:** Benevolence, harmony, and the avoidance of “cold god” detachment
