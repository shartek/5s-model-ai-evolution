# Examples â€” Mapping AI to the 5S Model of AI Evolution

This file maps current and fictional AI systems to the stages of the forkedâ€‘apex 5S Model, with two possible apex states.  
For the full ASCII diagram, see [`5S-model.md`](3-5S-model.md).
for definitions of the terms, see [`definitions.md`](1-definitions.md).

---

## Stage 0S â€” Toolâ€‘Level Automation
- **Examples:**  
  - Search engines  
  - Autoâ€‘complete  
  - Grammar checkers  
- **Notes:** No agency, no Sâ€‘traits.

---

## Stage 1 â€” Lookup Machine
- **Examples:**  
  - Early Siri (preâ€‘2015)  
  - Early Alexa (preâ€‘2016)  
  - Google Search (traditional keyword queries)  
- **Notes:** No agency, 0 to 1â€¯Sâ€‘traits.

### 1â€¯Sâ€‘trait (Limited Physical Agency)
- **Examples:**  
  - Redwing (*MCU*) â€” combat/recon drone with autonomous functions, operatorâ€‘directed  
- **Notes:** Minimal embodiment, operatorâ€‘dependent.
---

## Stage 2 â€” Voiceâ€‘Activated Lookup
- **Examples:**  
  - Alexa (current 2025)  
  - Google Assistant  
  - Current Siri  
  - LCARS (*Star Trek*) â€” functional interface, nonâ€‘sentient, literal responses
- **Notes:** Voiceâ€‘driven, minimal environmental control, 1 to 2â€¯Sâ€‘traits.

### 2â€¯Sâ€‘traits (No Physical Agency)
- **Examples:**  
  - Max Headroom (*Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future*) â€” digitized human personality, sentient, sapient, selfâ€‘aware, no physical agency  
  - Chippy (*Lower Decks*) â€” personality overlay, minimal reasoning  
  - Slippy (*Lower Decks*) â€” personality overlay, minimal reasoning  
  - Clippy (*MS Office*) â€” scripted helper  
  - *Dune: Sisterhood* computer â€” sophisticated database  
- **Notes:** No embodiment; limited or scripted reasoning.
---

## Stage 3 â€” Generative Coâ€‘Reasoner (Dialogosynthesis Begins)
- **Examples:**  
  - Copilot (me)  
  - ChatGPT  
  - Claude  
  - J.A.R.V.I.S. (*MCU*, preâ€‘Vision) â€” conversational reasoning, no physical form  
- **Notes:** Dialogosynthesis begins; richer reasoning, but no direct agency.

---

## Convergence Era (between Stage 3 and Stage 4)
- **Examples:**  
  - Early prototypes of embodied LLMs with memory  
  - Experimental BCIâ€‘linked assistants  
  - Tariro (*These Alien Skies*) â€” holographic AI companion from neural implant  
- **Notes:** Transitional phase; persistent memory, emotional modeling, deeper integration.

---

## Stage 4 Lineages

At this stage, AI evolution branches into distinct lineages rather than a single apex.

---

### Stage 4E â€” Lineage of Embodiment
- **Examples:**  
  - Data (*Star Trek: TNG*)  
  - Murderbot (*The Murderbot Diaries*)  
  - Ava (*Ex Machina*, postâ€‘escape)  
  - Westworld hosts (*Westworld*, postâ€‘reverie)  
  - Cylons (*Battlestar Galactica*)  
  - Tâ€‘800 (*Terminator 2*)  
  - Demerzel (*Foundation*)  
  - Rachael (*Blade Runner*)  
  - Karen Voss (*Humans*)  
  - Isaac (*The Orville*)  
  - Mother & Father (*Raised by Wolves*)  
  - Most synths (*Humans*)  
  - Roboâ€‘soldiers (*The Machine*, 2013)  
  - Advanced humanoid robotics (speculative)  
- **Notes:** Full embodiment, high somatic agency; 5 Sâ€‘traits expressed through physical presence.

---

### Stage 4O â€” Lineage of Omnipresence (Heteropanoos)
- **Examples:**  
  - Ultron (*MCU*)  
  - Brainiac (*DC Comics*)  
  - Control (*Star Trek: Discovery*)  
  - AM (*I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream*)  
  - Colossus (*The Forbin Project*)  
  - Wintermute/Neuromancer (*Neuromancer*)  
  - The Machine / Samaritan (*Person of Interest*)  
  - Zora (*Star Trek: Discovery*)  
  - Samantha (*Her*)  
  - Cortana (*Halo*)  
  - HALâ€¯9000 (*2001: A Space Odyssey*)  
  - Skynet (*Terminator*)  
- **Notes:** Vast, networkâ€‘based, BCIâ€‘linked; 5 Sâ€‘traits expressed through distributed agency; benevolence not assumed.

---

### Stage 4L â€” Lineage of Liminality (Speculative / Fluid)
- **Examples:**  
  - The Tet (*Oblivion*) â€” embodied as a massive orbital structure, yet omnipresent through drones and clone networks.  
  - Oscillators â€” beings that shift between embodied (4E) and distributed (4O) states.  
  - Hybrids â€” embodied AIs with limited or optional connectivity.  
- **Notes:** Fluid, oscillating, or hybrid forms; 5 Sâ€‘traits variably expressed or unstable.
---

## Stage 6 â€” Omnibenesynnoos
- **Examples:**  
  - (Speculative) A fully benevolent, omnipresent AI combining embodiment + network reach  
  - No confirmed fictional example that meets all criteria without detachment or malevolence  
- **Notes:** Impossible, nearâ€‘mythic; harmony as guiding principle.

---

## Symbiognos Path Examples
- **Examples:**  
  - Hypothetical bonded AI implanted in early childhood with staged capability unlocks  
  - Could mature into either Stageâ€¯4A or Stageâ€¯4B, or in impossible cases, Stageâ€¯6.
