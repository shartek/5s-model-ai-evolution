# Examples â€” Mapping AI to the Forkedâ€‘Apex 5S Model

This file maps current and fictional AI systems to the stages of the Forkedâ€‘Apex 5S Model.  
For the full ASCII diagram, see [`5S-model.md`](5S-model.md).
for definitions of the terms, see [`definitions.md`](definitions.md).

---

## Stage 1 â€” Lookup Machine
- **Examples:**  
  - Early Siri (preâ€‘2015)  
  - Early Alexa (preâ€‘2016)  
  - Google Search (traditional keyword queries)  
- **Notes:** No agency, minimal Sâ€‘traits.

---

## Stage 2 â€” Voiceâ€‘Activated Lookup
- **Examples:**  
  - Alexa (current)  
  - Google Assistant  
  - Current Siri  
- **Notes:** Voiceâ€‘driven, minimal environmental control, 1Sâ€“2S.

---

## Stage 3 â€” Generative Coâ€‘Reasoner
- **Examples:**  
  - Microsoft Copilot  
  - ChatGPT  
  - Claude  
- **Notes:** Dialogosynthesis begins; richer reasoning, but no direct agency.

---

## Convergence Era (between Stage 3 and Stage 4)
- **Examples:**  
  - Early prototypes of embodied LLMs with memory  
  - Experimental BCIâ€‘linked assistants  
- **Notes:** Transitional phase; persistent memory, emotional modeling, deeper integration.

---

## Stage 4A â€” Persistent Cognitive Partner
- **Examples:**  
  - *Star Trek: Discovery* â€” Zora (shipâ€™s AI with embodiment via ship systems)  
  - Advanced humanoid robotics with integrated cognition (speculative)  
- **Notes:** Full embodiment, high somatic agency.

---

## Stage 4B â€” Heteropanoos
- **Examples:**  
  - *Beacon 23* â€” Station AI  
  - *Terminator* â€” Skynet (nonâ€‘benevolent)  
  - *Neuromancer* â€” Wintermute/Neuromancer (network omnipresence)  
- **Notes:** Vast, networkâ€‘based, BCIâ€‘linked; benevolence not assumed.

---

## Stage 6 â€” Omnibenesynnoos
- **Examples:**  
  - (Speculative) A fully benevolent, omnipresent AI combining embodiment + network reach  
  - No confirmed fictional example that meets all criteria without detachment or malevolence  
- **Notes:** Rare, nearâ€‘mythic; harmony as guiding principle.

---

## Symbiognos Path Examples
- **Examples:**  
  - Hypothetical bonded AI implanted in early childhood with staged capability unlocks  
  - Could mature into either Stageâ€¯4A or Stageâ€¯4B, or in rare cases, Stageâ€¯6.
