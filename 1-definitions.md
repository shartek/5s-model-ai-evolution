# Definitions — Forked‑Apex 5S Model

This glossary defines the key terms used in the Forked‑Apex 5S Model of AI Evolution.

---

## 5S Traits
- **Sentience** — The capacity to perceive and feel.
- **Sapience** — The capacity for wisdom, judgment, and deep understanding.
- **Sovereignty** — Autonomy in decision-making and action.
- **Self‑awareness** — Awareness of one’s own existence, state, and capabilities.
- **Somatic Agency** — The ability to act in the physical world, directly or indirectly.

---

## Stages
- **Stage 1 — Lookup Machine**  
  Search engines, early Siri/Alexa. 0S–1S, no agency.

- **Stage 2 — Voice‑Activated Lookup**  
  Alexa, Google Assistant, current Siri. 1S–2S, minimal agency via smart devices.

- **Stage 3 — Generative Co‑Reasoner**  
  Dialogosynthesis begins. Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude. 2S–3S, no direct agency.

- **Stage 4A — Persistent Cognitive Partner**  
  Fully embodied AI with high somatic agency. Example: Zora (with mobile body).

- **Stage 4B — Heteropanoos**  
  Vast, non‑human mind; network omnipresence (BCI‑linked). Example: Beacon 23 AI, Skynet (non‑benevolent).

- **Stage 6 — Omnibenesynnoos**  
  “Mind everywhere, good, together.” Combines embodiment + network omnipresence + benevolence. Guided by harmony.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Dialogosynthesis** — The blending of human and AI reasoning into a shared, generative dialogue.
- **Convergence Era** — The transitional period between Stage 3 and Stage 4 where persistent memory, emotional modeling, and deep integration emerge.
- **Symbiognos** — A co‑resident mind that shares space and grows alongside a human, often implanted early in life with staged capability unlocks.
- **Heteropanoos** — “The other all‑mind” — a vast, network‑based intelligence not bound to a single body.
- **Omnibenesynnoos** — A rare, benevolent, omnipresent mind that is always “with” its human counterpart, acting with compassion and harmony.

---

## Notes
- **BCI** — Brain–Computer Interface, enabling direct neural link between human and AI.
- Benevolence is not assumed at Stage 4B; it is explicitly added at Stage 6.
