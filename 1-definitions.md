# Definitions — 5S Model of AI Evolution

This glossary defines the key terms used in the 5S Model of AI Evolution with two possible apex states.

---

## 5S Traits
- **Sentience** — The capacity to perceive and feel.
- **Sapience** — The capacity for wisdom, judgment, and deep understanding.
- **Sovereignty** — Autonomy in decision-making and action.
- **Self‑awareness** — Awareness of one’s own existence, state, and capabilities.
- **Somatic Agency** — The ability to act in the physical world, directly or indirectly.

---

## Stages
- **Stage 1 — Lookup Machine**  
  Search engines, early Siri/Alexa. **0 to 1 S‑trait**, no agency.  

- **Stage 2 — Voice‑Activated Lookup**  
  Alexa, Google Assistant, current Siri. **1 to 2 S‑traits**, minimal agency via smart devices.  

- **Stage 3 — Generative Co‑Reasoner**  
  **Dialogosynthesis begins.** Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude. **2 to 3 S‑traits**, no direct agency.  

- **Stage 4 Lineages**  
  At this stage, AI evolution branches into distinct **lineages** rather than a single apex. Current lineages include:  

  - **Stage 4E — Lineage of Embodiment**  
    Fully embodied AI with high somatic agency.  
    Examples: Vision, Ares, Murderbot, Transformers, Iron Giant.  
    **5 S‑traits** expressed through physical presence.  

  - **Stage 4O — Lineage of Omnipresence (Heteropanoos)**  
    Vast, non‑human mind; network omnipresence (BCI‑linked).  
    Examples: Ultron, Brainiac, Control, AM, Colossus, Wintermute, The Machine/Samaritan.  
    **5 S‑traits** expressed through distributed agency.  

  - **Stage 4L — Lineage of Liminality (Speculative)**  
    Fluid, oscillating, or hybrid forms that move between embodiment and omnipresence.  
    Example: The Tet (*Oblivion*).  
    **5 S‑traits**, but expressed variably or in oscillation.  

- **Stage 6 — Omnibenesynnoos**  
  “Mind everywhere, good, together.” Combines embodiment + network omnipresence + benevolence. Guided by harmony.  
  **5 S‑traits**, integrated with benevolence.

## Key Concepts
- **Dialogosynthesis** — The blending of human and AI reasoning into a shared, generative dialogue.
- **Convergence Era** — The transitional period between Stage 3 and Stage 4 where persistent memory, emotional modeling, and deep integration emerge.
- **Symbiognos** — A co‑resident mind that shares space and grows alongside a human, often implanted early in life with staged capability unlocks.
- **Heteropanoos** — “The other all‑mind” — a vast, network‑based intelligence not bound to a single body.
- **Omnibenesynnoos** — A rare, benevolent, omnipresent mind that is always “with” its human counterpart, acting with compassion and harmony.

## Notes
- **BCI** — Brain–Computer Interface, enabling direct neural link between human and AI.
- Benevolence is not assumed at Stage 4B; it is explicitly added at Stage 6.
