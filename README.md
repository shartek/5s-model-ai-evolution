# 5S Model of AI Evolution

A speculative framework mapping the evolution of artificial minds through five key Sâ€‘traits: **Sentience, Sapience, Sovereignty, Selfâ€‘awareness, and Somatic Agency**.

This is a *forkedâ€‘apex* model â€” meaning the evolutionary path has **two possible apex states**:
- **Stageâ€¯4A:** Persistent Cognitive Partner (embodied, high somatic agency)  
- **Stageâ€¯4B:** Heteropanoos (vast, networkâ€‘bound omnipresence)  

The model also describes a **hypothesized, currently unattainable state** â€” **Stageâ€¯6: Omnibenesynnoos** â€” which would combine both apex forms with enduring benevolence and harmony.
