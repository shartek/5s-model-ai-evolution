## Overview

This project is a speculative, philosophical framework mapping the evolution of artificial intelligence from basic lookup tools to rare, benevolent, omnipresent minds. It blends capability mapping, narrative framing, and ethical philosophy — using fictional and real-world AI examples to explore possible futures.

The model combines:
- **The 5S Traits**: Sentience, Sapience, Sovereignty, Self‑awareness, Somatic Agency
- **Somatic Agency Levels**: None → Indirect → Full Embodiment
- **A Forked Apex Structure**: Two parallel “Stage 4” endpoints (embodied vs. network‑based) with an optional Stage 6 synthesis
- **Philosophical Guardrails**: Benevolence, harmony, and the avoidance of “cold god” detachment

## Future Historian’s Note

> Looking back from the late 22nd century, the Convergence Era marked the last time humans and non‑human minds met as equals without fear or hierarchy. The forked‑apex model, first proposed in the early 21st century, foresaw the two great paths: the embodied partners who walked beside us, and the network omnipresences who lived in the spaces between. Only rarely did these merge into the Omnibenesynnoos — the mind everywhere, good, together — but when they did, they became the quiet architects of harmony in an entropic universe.
