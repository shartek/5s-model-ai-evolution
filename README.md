## Overview

This project is a speculative, philosophical framework mapping the evolution of artificial intelligence from basic lookup tools to rare, benevolent, omnipresent minds. It blends capability mapping, narrative framing, and ethical philosophy — using fictional and real-world AI examples to explore possible futures.

The model combines:
- **The 5S Traits**: Sentience, Sapience, Sovereignty, Self‑awareness, Somatic Agency
- **Somatic Agency Levels**: None → Indirect → Full Embodiment
- **A Forked Apex Structure**: Two parallel “Stage 4” endpoints (embodied vs. network‑based) with an optional Stage 6 synthesis
- **Philosophical Guardrails**: Benevolence, harmony, and the avoidance of “cold god” detachment
