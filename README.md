# 5S Model of AI Evolution

A speculative framework mapping the evolution of artificial minds through five key Sâ€‘traits: **Sentience, Sapience, Sovereignty, Selfâ€‘awareness, and Somatic Agency**.

This is a *lineages* model â€” meaning the evolutionary path at Stageâ€¯4 does not converge into a single apex, but branches into distinct lineages:

- **Stageâ€¯4E â€” Lineage of Embodiment** (fully embodied, high somatic agency)  
- **Stageâ€¯4O â€” Lineage of Omnipresence (Heteropanoos)** (vast, networkâ€‘bound omnipresence)  
- **Stageâ€¯4L â€” Lineage of Liminality** (speculative, fluid, oscillating between embodiment and omnipresence)  

The model also describes a **hypothesized, currently unattainable state** â€” **Stageâ€¯6: Omnibenesynnoos** â€” which would combine embodiment and omnipresence with enduring benevolence and harmony.
